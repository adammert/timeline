# Product Guidelines - Timeline Visualizer

## Design Philosophy
The Timeline Visualizer aims to be a tool that feels both powerful and invisible. It should empower users to organize complex information without the interface getting in the way.

## Visual Identity
- **Tone:** The application maintains a **Professional and Clean** aesthetic, prioritizing data clarity.
- **Modernity:** **Dynamic** elements like smooth scroll animations and transitions are used to provide a polished, high-end user experience.
- **Accessibility:** The design is **Friendly and Accessible**, using clear typography, intuitive icons, and high-contrast elements.

## UI/UX Principles
- **Clarity over Density:** The layout prioritizes readability. Even with a large number of events, the interface should remain uncluttered and easy to navigate.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Distinct visual cues (colors, borders) are used for different event categories (e.g., `critical`, `warning`, `success`) to allow for quick scanning.
- **Seamless Themes:** Both Light and Dark modes are first-class citizens, providing a consistent and eye-strain-free experience in any environment.

## Interaction Guidelines
- **Instant Feedback:** The "Markdown-to-Visual" loop must be as fast as possible. Real-time rendering is the standard.
- **Non-Destructive Editing:** User data safety is paramount. Robust Auto-save and multi-level Undo/Redo are core requirements for any editing feature.
- **Keyboard Efficiency:** Whenever possible, features should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to cater to power users and improve workflow speed.
